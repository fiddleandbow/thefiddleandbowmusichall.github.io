      <h1>About The Fiddle & Bow Music Hall</h1>
      <p><p>If you look closely at our logo across the front of our downtown venue, you’ll notice the silhouette of a fiddler. This is the silhouette of a local named Mack MaGaha. “Mac” was born on August 1st, 1929 in Honea Path, SC, and passed away in August 2003. He was commonly known as the “dancing fiddle man” and was called a “ball of fire out there” by Porter Wagoner. Mack MaGaha was part of Porter Wagoner’s band for over 20 years. This was a big accomplishment for a small-town fiddle player. We would love to be a starting point for another small-town talent to reach such heights. Part of our mission is to do just this, promote local talent. <br><br>
        A local fiddle player sharing his gift and passion with the world is what inspired our name and mission at The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall. Our passion doesn’t stop with music though. Folk art particularly that from the Southeastern United States is another passion we have and share at The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall. The old brick walls in our small downtown building are decorated with one of the best private collections of folk art in the state and art by the venue owner, Justin Thomas Atkin. Justin is a well-known folk artist himself. You can find out more about his art <a href="https://www.andersonobserver.com/news/paintings-storytelling-bring-acclaim-to-local-artist">here</a>. The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall’s art collection includes pieces by Reverend Jimmy Morrow, Reverend Howard Finster, Mary Proctor, and more. Feel free to appreciate this lovely art genre while you wait for a show to start.
