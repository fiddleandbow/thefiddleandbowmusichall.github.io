      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p>At The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall, we prioritize a family-friendly atmosphere where we strive to share our love for music, southern folk art, and to promote local talent. The list below includes some frequently asked questions. If you're on this page with a question, you may find your answer below. For instance, parking, food, alcohol, photography, etc. are all answered on this page. If you can't find what you need, contact us <a href="Contact.html" class="link-primary">here</a>. </p>

      <h1>Do you serve or allow alcohol?</h1>
      <p>No, but we do serve Coke which pairs well with Moon Pies that we also sell. Sorry, we don't serve alcohol and by "Coke" we mean we have canned drinks. Everything in the South is "Coke" regardless of brand. We ask that you not bring alcohol to The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall. We strive to always have a family-friendly environment safe for all ages. Justin says, "The music is so good that you don't have to get drunk to enjoy it!"</p>

      <h1>Where can I park?</h1>
      <p>We are downtown in small-town USA so, there is very little activity going on at the same time as our shows. There is parking along the street, behind the building, and across the street. Just don't park anywhere marked "No Parking." For instance, the Police Department across from the venue. You'd surely get a ticket for that. The sheriff might come to a show or two but, we're not in that good with him.</p>

      <h1>What if someone in my party is in a wheelchair?</h1>
      <p>No problem. We will accommodate you however possible. Our venue is ADA-compliant.</p>

      <h1>What is your refund policy?</h1>
      <p>Well, we really hate that you can't make it, but we understand that things come up. Reach out to us and let us know what's going on. We'll do everything we can to be sure you're happy. You can contact us <a href="Contact.html" class="link-primary">here</a>.</p>

      <h1>Do you allow photography?</h1>
      <p>Sure, pictures are no problem. The only time this would matter would be if the performing artist didn't want photography. We haven’t run into that yet, but if we do, we'll address it at that time. We would also communicate this at the show, on our social media, and on event posters. If you do take pictures, please be sure to tag us on social media - @thefiddleandbowmusichall. Also, please be courteous of your neighbor and don't block their view of the show.</p>

      <h1>How does my band get on stage?</h1>
      <p>If you are an artist who is interested in performing at The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall or the manager of an artist, the best thing to do is contact us directly. We'd much rather talk with you in person to be sure all your questions are answered completely. You can contact us <a href="Contact.html" class="link-primary">here</a>.</p>

      <h1>How do I purchase some of your folk art?</h1>
      <p>If you want to buy original art by Justin Thomas Atkin, you can contact us <a href="Contact.html" class="link-primary">here</a> or watch our page to see when he'll be at local art events. We try to advertise local art shows he is planning to attend on our social media. You can contact us <a href="Contact.html" class="link-primary">here</a> to set up a time to browse the art we have for sale at The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall or visit our store <a href="Store.html" class="link-primary">here</a>.</p>

      <h1>Are there hotels nearby that you recommend?</h1>
      <p>If you are coming from out of town and need a place to stay, there are hotels in Anderson, SC which is about a 45-minute ride from the venue. We recommend the Holiday Inn on Clemson Boulevard. You can find directions <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Holiday+Inn+Anderson,+an+IHG+Hotel/@34.54864,-82.6785156,17z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x88586ecc72ee2451:0x6fca7e8d4ee1355e!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d34.5486356!4d-82.6759353!16s%2Fg%2F1tj227x4?entry=ttu" class="link-primary">here</a>.</p>

      <h1>Are there restaurants nearby that you recommend?</h1>
      <p>In downtown Honea Path, SC, we recommend Lou & Perry’s.  Their hours are 6AM to 10PM and they are closed on Monday and Tuesday. Lou & Perry’s is about a 5-minute ride from The Fiddle and Bow Music Hall. If you don’t know what to order, they are well known for the grilled chicken but, get whatever you’d like. You can find directions to Lou and Perry’s <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lou+%26+Perry's/@34.4526656,-82.4059661,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8858101c4de6b161:0x22c88e6e49099f07!8m2!3d34.4526612!4d-82.4033858!16s%2Fg%2F1wtbvlpm?entry=ttu" class="link-primary">here</a>.</p>

      <h1>How do I buy tickets?</h1>
      <p>There are 3 ways to do this. One, you can order tickets online on our calendar page <a href="Calendar.html" class="link-primary">here</a>. Find the show and click on the button below it that says “Tickets.” You can also contact us <a href="Contact.html" class="link-primary">here</a> and purchase tickets over the phone. The box office hours are 7AM to 9PM. Finally, you can buy tickets at the door. Depending on the show, we may or may not have any available at the door. We recommend buying tickets by phone or online early to make sure you reserve one of our 115 seats.</p>
